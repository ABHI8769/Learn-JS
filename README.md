### Learning JS
This section covers the essentials of JavaScript. From variables to functions, loops to conditional statements, you'll get a solid foundation in the language.

### JavaScript Basics
If you're new to JavaScript, start here. This section covers the basic building blocks of the language.

### DOM Manipulation

### Events
JavaScript events make your web pages responsive and interactive. Discover how to handle user actions and create event-driven applications.

### Async JS
Asynchronous JavaScript is crucial for handling tasks that take time, such as fetching data from servers or handling user input. Dive into asynchronous programming with this section.

### Promises
Promises provide a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code. Understand how to use promises for better code organization and error handling.

### APIs
Learn how to work with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Understand how to fetch data from external sources and integrate it into your applications.

### Call, This, Bind
Master the concepts of `call`, `this`, and `bind`. Understand how to control the value of `this` in different contexts.

## Mini Projects
